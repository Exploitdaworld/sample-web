CI/CD Pipeline (Github Action+ECR+Docker)
Project Overview: CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions, ECR & Docker
Overview
Our project aims to streamline the software development lifecycle by automating the build, test, and deployment processes. Weâ€™ll achieve this using a robust CI/CD pipeline that integrates seamlessly with GitHub, leverages ECR for container image storage, and relies on Docker for containerization.
A CI/CD pipeline with Docker, GitHub, and Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) streamlines the process of building, testing, and deploying containerized applications. Here's an outline of how it typically works:
1. *Code Repository (GitHub):* Developers commit code changes to a GitHub repository, which serves as the central source of truth for the application's codebase.
2. *Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions:* GitHub Actions is configured to listen for changes in the repository. When new code is pushed, GitHub Actions triggers the CI pipeline.
3. *Build Docker Image:* The CI pipeline uses a Dockerfile in the repository to build a Docker image. This image contains the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments.
4. *Test:* After building the Docker image, the pipeline runs tests to verify the application's functionality and performance.
5. *Push Docker Image to ECR:* Once the tests pass, the CI pipeline pushes the Docker image to Amazon ECR, a fully managed container registry that makes it easy to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images.
6. *Continuous Deployment (CD) with GitHub Actions:* Another GitHub Actions workflow is triggered by the successful completion of the CI pipeline. This workflow handles the deployment of the Docker image to the target environment, such as a staging or production environment.
7. *Deploy to ECS or EKS:* The CD pipeline deploys the Docker image to Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) or Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), where the application runs in containers managed by AWS.
